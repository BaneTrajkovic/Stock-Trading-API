# Stock Trading API

## About

***Designed***, ***implemented*** and ***tested*** stock trading API in development team, for website specialising in the buying / selling of stocks from the twelve FTSE-100 companies operating in the financial sector.

Since the website processes very large number of requests, right data structures and algorithms have to be used in order to efficiently support all of the required operations.

Evaluation of the solution was done both *theoretically* (space and time complexity) and *experimentally*. Regarding experimentation, the experimental framework was implemented to test validity and measure performance of various API operations under different conditions.

## Guide

***Report.pdf*** describes the choice of *data structures* and *algorithms* used to realise the API. Furthermore, it includes *theoretical* analysis (covers both space and time complexity, both in the average and worst-case scenarios) and *experimental* analysis of the solution.

***StockTradingAPI.ipynb*** includes the implementation of the API, as well as its experimental framework.
